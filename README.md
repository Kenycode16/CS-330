Project Dashboard 
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs requires adhering to best practices such as clean code structure, consistent naming conventions, and modular design. In Project One, the CRUD Python module was pivotal in connecting the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, enabling seamless data management while reducing redundancy and enhancing reusability. This approach provided flexibility for future applications, such as integrating with APIs or managing other data systems. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into manageable components, as I did with Grazioso Salvare’s database and dashboard requirements. This involved analyzing data needs, designing an efficient schema, and leveraging MongoDB queries to meet the organization’s goals. Compared to previous assignments, this project emphasized end-to-end integration, teaching me to focus on data flow and user experience. Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing systems that enhance efficiency and drive innovation, which is evident in how the Grazioso Salvare dashboard streamlined rescue operations, saving time and improving decision-making. By combining modular tools with a client-focused approach, this project demonstrated how technology can directly support organizational goals and make a meaningful impact.
